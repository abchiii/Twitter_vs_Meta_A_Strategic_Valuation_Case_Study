Course: FNCE30011 Essentials of Corporate Valuation

## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive relative valuation of Twitter Inc., using Meta Platforms Inc. as the primary strategic comparator. The analysis was conducted during the high-volatility period of Elon Musk’s initial takeover bid in April 2022.

## Research Questions
This analysis seeks to address the following key questions:
1. How does isolating core operations from surplus assets alter the perceived valuation of tech giants?
2. To what extent does a major strategic pivot (e.g., Meta’s Metaverse transition) distort traditional PE multiples compared to industry peers?
3. Is Elon Musk’s takeover offer of $54.20 per share justified when benchmarked against the core earnings multiples of comparable firms?
4. How do non-financial factors, such as the "Bots" controversy and due diligence findings, impact market confidence and equity pricing in real-time?

## Methodology
The valuation follows a three-step adjustment process:
1. **Earnings Normalisation**: Calculating TTM Earnings After Tax (EAT) and excluding after-tax surplus asset income.
2. **Equity Adjustment**: Adjusting Market Capitalisation for surplus assets such as cash, marketable securities, and goodwill.
3. **Multiple Application**: Applying Meta’s "clean" PE(core operations) to Twitter’s core earnings to derive a theoretical intrinsic value.

## Key Financial Insights
* **Core Operations Isolation**: Unlike standard PE analysis, this study deconstructs the PE ratio by separating Core Operations from Surplus Assets. 
* **Valuation Gap**: The study reveals that Twitter was trading at a market equity value of $37.46 billion, which was overpriced by a factor of more than four compared to its calculated firm equity value of $9.19 billion based on Meta’s multiples.
* **Market Sentiment Analysis**: The analysis explains why Meta’s low PE(core operations) of 12.90 reflects a "strategy pivot risk" into the Metaverse, whereas Twitter’s astronomical PE (core operations) of 236.37 reflects high speculative growth and takeover premiums.

## Takeover Evaluation
The report evaluates Elon Musk’s $54.20 per share offer, noting a control premium of only 10.57%, significantly lower than the industry average of 20% to 35%. It further discusses how the "Bots" controversy impacted Twitter's valuation and caused the share price to crash to $37.

## Conclusion
To achieve a reliable comparison of Twitter’s value and Musk’s offer, an Independent Expert’s Report would be required. This study highlights the challenges of using a single comparator in a volatile market where risk and growth potential differ significantly between firms.
Ultimately, this analysis demonstrates that while quantitative multiples suggest an overvaluation, the qualitative risks—such as Meta’s strategic pivot and Twitter’s platform integrity issues—are the primary drivers of the observed valuation gap.
